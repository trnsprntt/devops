**Put an output of kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc command.**

**Use several tabs in your browser, incognito mode, etc to access the root path of your app. Check the content of your file, in each pod, provide the output of the command for all replicas.**

**Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for replicas.**

The pods are created one by one sequentially, and the PVC is requested during the pod creation. The PVC is named as volumeClaimTemplate name + pod-name + ordinal number. The volume is mount to the respective ordinal pod, therefore pod-0 is not able to access pod-1's PVC and vice versa. Although having a mutual storage volume might be useful sometimes, most often it adds too much management overheads than benefits to be used as a default option. The pods access time demonstrate that PVC's are being accessed separately.

**For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Describe in the report why. Then find a way to tell to the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel. Implement it.**

Since the pods are not communicating with each other and are totally independent from one another, it's enough to only provide uniqueness and not necessarily ordering. In order not to wait for Pods to become Running and Ready or completely terminated prior to launching or terminating another Pod, we may add `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"`.

### Bonus 2

There are 2 types of update strategies - OnDelete and RollingUpdate. 

* OnDelete - the StatefulSet controller does not automatically update the Pods in the StatefulSet. Users must delete Pods by themselves to launch producing new pods by the controller.
* RollingUpdate - each Pod is deleted and recreated by the controller. It will update each Pod one at a time in the same order as Pod termination (from the greatest ordinal to the lowest). It is also possible to specify minimum ready seconds value or split the pods to several group to run updates on.
