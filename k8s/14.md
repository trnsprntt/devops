### Kube Prometheus Stack

* **The Prometheus Operator** - Prometheus, Alertmanager, and similar monitoring components are deployed and configured using Kubernetes custom resources.
* **Highly available Prometheus** -  gathers and saves metrics as time series data, which means that metrics data is kept alongside the timestamp at which it was captured, as well as optional key-value pairs known as labels.
* **Highly available Alertmanager** - client programs, such as the Prometheus server, provide alerts to this service. It deduplicates, groups, and routes them to the appropriate receiver integrations.
* **Prometheus node-exporter** - exposes metrics that Prometheus may scrape, including a wide range of system metrics (prefixed with node_) further down in the output.
* **Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs** - at regular intervals, the adaptor collects the names of accessible metrics from Prometheus, and then only exposes metrics that follow particular formats.
* **kube-state-metrics** - a service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about object state. It focuses on the health of the many objects inside Kubernetes, rather than the health of the individual Kubernetes components.
* **Grafana** - open source tool for performing data analytics, retrieving metrics that make sense of large amounts of data, and monitoring our apps using cool configurable dashboards.

`kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc,cm`
Lists and briefly describes pods, stateful sets, services, persistent volume claims and configmaps respectively

1. Check how much CPU and Memory your StatefulSet is consuming.

2. Check which Pod is using CPU more than others and which is less in the default namespace.

3. Check how much memory is used on your node, in % and mb.

5. Check which Pod is using network more than others and which is less in the default namespace.

6. Check how many alerts you have. Also you can see them in the Web UI by the minikube service monitoring-kube-prometheus-alertmanager command.
