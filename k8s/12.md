### Bonus

**Headless service** allows interaction directly with the Pods instead of a proxy and retrieves associated pods IPs.

**Affinity** decides which pods are eligible to bind to a node depending upon the label of pods.

**Anti-affinity** setting the rules for pods' labels (just like afffinity), but for releasing the pods.

**Taints** are a property of *nodes* that push pods away if they don't tolerate this taint. 

**Tolerations** are applied to *pods*, and allow the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.

**Taints and tolerations** works together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. 

**Node selector** allows scheduling a pod onto a node whose labels match the nodeSelector labels specified by the user.
